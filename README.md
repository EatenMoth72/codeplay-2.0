# codeplay-2.0
Codeplay  - for Codemill AB

-Background-
  Codemill has come up with a new product that will revolutionize the usage of video on
  webpages. They need someone to build this product and create a webpage to present it on.

-Assignment-
  Create an html5 video player that is branded for Codemill by customizing the control buttons.
  Also make it possible to switch between a few different videos.
  Design and build a webpage that presents the product in a modern and Codemill branded
  way. The webpage needs to be build in a responsive way so it fits desktops, surf pads and
  mobile phones.
  Depending if there is a lot of time left when this is done, the team will be starting on a
  miniature MAM (Media Asset Management).

-Available assets
● Video clips for testing
● Graphical profile for Codemill
● Staff to user test on

-Work-
  Each day the team will be joining Codemills team Dragon on the daily standup meeting to
  update team Dragon on the project progress but also to get a feel for what we are doing here
  at Codemill.
  Each Friday there will be a demo for the teamleader of team Dragon (Annica) of the work so
  far and a together make plan for next week.
